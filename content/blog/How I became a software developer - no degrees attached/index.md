#How I became a software developer - no degrees attached

Last month, I got my first programming job, well now I can say "It was worth it". The 2 years.

Now to be honest I don't think it should take someone 2 years. It depends on what other things the person has going on in Life.
I had school, you might have something else.
The proficiency that I have with code is totally not necessary for someone to get an entry level job. In fact, I could have gotten the same level of job a year ago, but I messed up some things for myself.
