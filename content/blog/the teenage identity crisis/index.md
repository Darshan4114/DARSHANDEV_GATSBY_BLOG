# teenage identity crisis

## the setting: planning out your life

Growing up is not easy. I was a kid who had a plan for his life, all figured out. What to do? When to do? and What to do? all of it.
I used to think what kind of people are these who don't know what they are going to do with their effin lives, they are just too stupid to plan it out. Now to be honest the plan was given to me readymade by my father, which must be noted. Although I partially agreed with the plan I didn't ever feel I was all in for it.

## the conflict

After some 3-4 years I was in 11th grade, I weird place to be in. I realized the dangers of having a fixed concrete plan for my life. I realized the time I had was limited and I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do with it, this is when I felt fear. I felt it flow through my entire body. I didn't know what was supposed to be my next step. The whole world was collapsing around me.
I feared making the wrong choice. I wanted to know what was the best course of action.
So, what did I do?
I read, and read, 1 self help book a day. After a couple of weeks I realized many of them were the same content modified in some or the other way.
Society is an important aspect of this problem,
I'm an indian more specifically I come from an indian middle class family, there indian kids are either doctors, engineers or lawyers (or work in a government job). Kids by the time they are in 10th grade are supposed to know their life path as they have to choose either - science, commerce, humanities for 11th and 12th grades. Which also determines which entrance exams they can take and what their careers will be.
Now that's a lot of pressure when you don't know which box you fit in the best and people are looking at you and you have to fit in a box.
Now the pressure is much higher in the middle class, as the general family structure is, most of the families have a earning father and a homemaker mother and there's a strong reason not to try anything crazy coz you might end up jobless and risk the future of your family.
And did I mention that I am a boy.
What are you going to do anyways? make youtube videos! or start a damn business of a castle in the air with no effing capital to do it!
Its just not easy to handle all of this.

## the why

One goal of this post might be to sympathise with my other fellow people who find themselves in the same situation. I want you to know you are not alone.
We all go through the process of self-discovery throughout our lives and when there are major breakthroughs we call them crisis(you might have heard of the adolescent crisis, of which we are talking right now and then there's also a mid-life crisis) It is always better to be aware of your life and strive to make it fulfilling as soon as possible. I'm glad I did.

## how did it start

How did I know I was going through this crisis?
The entrepreneur bug bit me, I wanted to
do something big. Something musklike. I just didn't know what and how of it.
I know many people who just want to do something significant but don't know the what or how of.

## resolution

I searched and searched. Came across software development.

India is a place full of developers, but the global demand is growing at an exponential pace, so I was sure if I were a software developer nothing could harm me. I would have the financial security and I would have the fulfillment of building things hands on. (I'm quite a hands on person, I like to open things, discover how they work and build stuff on my own). It was cool.
Plus I was sure I'll make a ton of money that way, like creating software and selling it, more specifically a good SaaS (Software as a service). So web development it was.

And I didn't want to wait through 4 years to learn it if I could do it myself in much less time, so here I am working as a software developer nearly at the end of my 12th grade(After taking the self taught route.)

Now that I look back at it, I can say I'm pretty sure that giving somebody a plan for their life is a pretty bad idea. The person should discover it themselves. Through insight and contemplation about their lives and desires.

I wouldn't at all say that it was bad, it is a stressful situation that builds you. I would rather pity those who come to this realization later in life when your responsibilities are high and the flexibility of mind and body is low.
